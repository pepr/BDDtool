Story: BDD oriented description of the problem with acceptance scenarios

    As a normal user
    I want to capture my high-level view to the subproblem as normal sentences
    so that it does not enforce the knowledge of programming.

Scenario: vectors can be sized and resized
     Given: A vector with some items
      When: more capacity is reserved
      Then: the capacity changes but not the size
